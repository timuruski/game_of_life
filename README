CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE
=====================

Just mucking around with Game of Life in Ruby, learning about ANSI
control codes and writing terminal apps that control the screen more
directly.

The world can be setup using either a random seed, or with the DATA
constant. This is manually triggered by editing the program, but I'll
probably have it read from STDIN or have some sort user input loop
during setup so the world can be painted with a cursor.

  $ ruby conway.rb
