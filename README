CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE
=====================

Just mucking around with Game of Life in Ruby, learning about ANSI
control codes and writing terminal apps that control the screen more
directly.

The world can be setup using a random seed from env variable SEED or by
reading an input file. There are samples for a glider and a gosper
glider gun.

  $ ruby conway.rb glider

  $ SEED=42 ruby conway.rb
